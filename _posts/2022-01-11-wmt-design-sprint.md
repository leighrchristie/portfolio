## Background on WMT
The Workload Measurement Tool (WMT) was a third party supplied web based tool that was brought in house by the MoJ in 2022. In simple terms, the WMT measures work load and helps people to balance it.

The opportunity presented by the data available in WMT is greater than its current usage, with scope to improve further.

Myself and another Interaction Designer on the team decided to conduct a design sprint into the usage of WMT and how the data could be better used and presented, in a way that aligned with the users goals.

... which is shown in the screenshot below:
