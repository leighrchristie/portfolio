## Situation
After joining the Manage a Workforce team, I attended various courses on accessibility including internal designer focussed training and writing the brief for a DAC audit. 

## Task
From these courses and experiences, I have been able to critically assess the Manage a workforce service to make improvements and more inclusive for all users.

## Action
I have made several changes to the Manage a workforce Allocate a Person on Probation prototype since I joined the team which have been based around making the service more accessible. When I reviewed the service, I found that we had tables in a few pages of the service that had unhelpful action columns that would not have been screen reader friendly, as the column text said "View". The action column was taking the users to a page that had more information on the person on probation, so it made sense to change the link to be the first column of the table which was the name of the PoP. This meant that screen readers would be accessing the link as the first cell of the row, stopping them from having to tab through the rest of the information if it wasn't necessary and the screen reader (usually Dragon software) would be able to read out the name of the person as the link, giving the link much more context about where it would take the user and what they could expect to see, rather than 'view' for every PoP.

## Result
This change has been made in all the places within the live service now based on my recommendation and has also had the added benefit of creating a bit more space on the page.
