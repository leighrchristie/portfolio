## Situation
Due to the familiarity of the content (users selecting their region, delivery unit and teams), users were able to move through the select your teams journey with ease, and without fully reading the content. This meant that users generally only selected the team that they were managing, not those that they may also wish to allocate cases to if they were covering for a colleague, or working across teams.

## Action: Iterations
I initially trialled adding an ‘Important’ notification banner into the service to inform users of their team selection.

*Using the notification banner.*

This was combined with subsequent content on the selecting your team page, which informed the users of all the teams to select.

*Extra content about selecting teams.*

However, this was still not enough to stop users from assuming they understood the content of the page. I decided to add in some necessary friction into the design, to make users stop and read the content before continuing.

To do this, I decided to borrow elements of the [Start using a service pattern](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/start-using-a-service/), and create a ‘Before you start’ page.

*Before you start page.*

### Findings
The intent with this design is that users will stop and fully read the information before pressing the start button to select their teams. This screen is now the first page a user will see upon logging into the Allocate a Person on Probation service. Users may only see this screen once (unless they ‘clear’ their selection during the first transaction), but the content on the select your team page reiterates the information so users do not have to recall information from a few pages before.

This design was put live and successfully made users stop to read the content before continuing through the page.
