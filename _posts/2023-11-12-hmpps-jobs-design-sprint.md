## Background
We delivered the MVP of the HMPPS recruitment site which met the user needs identified at Discovery at a minimum level. It was now time to iterate to address some outstanding business needs.

The business asked for features that may fit in with user needs, but the features are solutions not user needs. We believe that these features have been requested to support the business with their advertising campaigns; recruiting for specific prisons. These business needs are very prison specific; but any solutions we came up with needed be appropriate for the whole HMPPS site.

## Task
We needed to break these features down from solutions and map them to established user needs.

*Breaking down the business need into "How might we?"*

This exercise lead us to the problem statement of How might we enable users to find jobs more relevant to them?

### User needs
> "I need to know where they are and whether I can commute to them." - User research participant

> "I […] searched jobs near Slough, then looked at pay because my rent has gone up 40%." - User research participant

> "[I] would need to check Google to see where these places are." - User research participant

## The Design Sprint

To try and resolve some of these outstanding issues, we ran a three day design sprint.

### Day one
The first day was used as a UCD pod to collate all the information and research we had into the problem. We had a stand up at the beginning of the day where we ran through expectations of the design day (day 2) and what outputs we were expecting.

### Day two
On the design day, we took the group through the problem we had identified and then did two rounds of sketching and voting. At the end of the day we picked two designs to take forward and test with participants on day 3.

By doing the design day as a group we managed to come up with 26 individual designs in 5 hours, which would not have been possible for one interaction designer to do on their own.

### Day three
On day three our user researchers conducted 10 sessions;
- 4 users online
- 6 users face to face

The aims of the session were to;
- explore job search behaviours
- test aspects of designs (location search, list view, map view)

## Next steps
The next steps were to determine whether the new filters identified in the second design were feasible. Was the data available?

We reviewed both the structured and unstructured data feed, along with the recruitment manager’s front end access for inputting the data and found that currently the data is not reliable and is inconsistent. There is no scope currently to improve the Oleeo feed or the behaviour of the recruitment managers, it is controlled by a 3rd party and we don’t own the relationship with them. It would require a lot of effort from our development team to manipulate the data into a usable format, and if Oleeo decide to change something then it could break the work of our team. It was therefore decided to pause these iterations until a later date, but the quick pace of the design sprint meant that we came up with solutions, tested them and assessed their feasibility within a week.
