## Background
From 26 June 2021, the new probation service is responsible for managing all those on a community order or licence following their release from prison in England and Wales.

A new case management system to replace legacy technology is a component of this programme.

### Breach in probation
Breaching a service user is an important part of managing a supervision of someone on probation. We needed to design a way for a probation practitioner to be able to keep track of where their service user is in the breach process in the new case management system.

### User needs
After researching with probation practitioners, we devised this statement at the beginning of a design sprint. It helped us to define the problem we were trying to solve.

> As a team we will design a dedicated space for breaching a person on probation in our service that captures information at the right time, automates as much as possible and surfaces information from court with clear actions and clear dates to improve our users' experience.x

## Design sprint
Once we had devised this hypothesis, I began to look at examples from both across government and beyond that had features we’d like to explore.

The team shared examples from bus applications, hotel booking sites to the GOV.UK passport application process.

To ensure we designed as a team in a consistent and accessible way, I worked with our UX team in Miro, instead of designing in code, which takes longer.

We delivered our ideas and it became apparent that we had all struggled individually with the scope of the design.

We did another round of independent time-boxed sketches in Miro, using our voting exercise to prioritise functionality.

I used components from my previous designs and from other members of the team’s designs. I focussed clearly on the user needs for an ‘overview’ of the stage of a breach, ensuring each of those needs were met, with particular attention on ensuring the practitioner knew what the next step of the journey was, in the call to action box.

After this round, it was much more apparent we’d reached a design consensus as there were many similar themes in the team's individual designs.

## Testing with users
Our user researcher conducted several usability tests over the course of three days. I took notes and observed the sessions, helping to create themes of feedback and appropriate actions to improve on in the prototype in an affinity diagram.

## Results
Users commented that the new workflow would enable them to work more efficiently when beginning the breach process; rather than clicking on multiple screens and compiling information themselves, there was a dedicated screen which did this for them. It would make creating the breach pack for court much more simple.
