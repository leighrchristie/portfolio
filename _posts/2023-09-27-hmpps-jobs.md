## Background
Recruitment and retention of HMPPS frontline staff is a major priority and the department’s greatest risk. 

On 30 November 2022, the Prisons and Probation Minister announced to MPs that an emergency contingency plan called Operation Safeguard had been triggered because of an “acute and sudden increase in the prison population”. Prison staffing is a contributing factor.

MoJ Communications planned an HMPPS brand campaign that launched in September 2023.
 
The campaign uses TV and online video, social media and digital audio to drive awareness and consideration of prison and probation jobs. 

## Task
Our role as part of this campaign was to create a new HMPPS jobs website that fit in with the brand campaign look & feel, as well as serving the users' need to find a job that suits them.

This topic had been looked at previously a number of times, so there was a wealth of previous research to look at.
