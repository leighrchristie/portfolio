## Background
In April 2023 we conducted user research into how we might expand our navigation offering on the WordPress Hale theme offered to our users, as well as address some user frustrations about how the secondary navigation interacted with user’s typical cursor behaviour. 

Users were finding the horizontal design of the secondary navigation hard to use due to the cursor moving out of the target area.

### User needs
The main findings were;
- Providing users with the option to use search bar or navigation is important to cater to different styles of navigating content
- Ensure there is a consistent navigation pattern across site
Continue to allow for the user to click on main nav headings and go directly to landing pages
- Use plain english throughout
- If using hover, include a vertical list of menu options
- Be explicit about where the user is in the journey; e.g. through the use of breadcrumbs

## Task: Problem statement
My task was to work closely with the front end developer to create a scalable and accessible design for primary and secondary navigation.

> How might we enable more complex structured sites to more easily use navigation on the Hale theme?

> How might we improve user’s experience of using the secondary navigation for simpler sites?

## Action: Iterations
I iterated through 3 versions of the design before we got to a place we felt would satisfy the user needs, not depend on javascript to be implemented (achievable using only CSS) and degrade gracefully if needed. Once the initial proof of concept had been coded, I decided to make some changes to how the menu worked when the user interacted with it.

### Version one
This version was the version that was tested as part of the research round, on the IMB site.

### Findings

## Results
The result of this was the primary navigation design we had worked on together went live in March 2024 and is being used successfully (with no accessibility issues) across multiple Website Builder sites where there are too many items in the primary navigation for the screen width.

### Future considerations
